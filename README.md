## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Producer-Consumer Pattern

A thread-safe producer-consumer pattern implementation using a bounded blocking queue in Python. This challenge demonstrates:

- Multi-threading and thread synchronization
- Bounded blocking queue implementation
- File I/O operations in a concurrent environment
- Comprehensive unit testing

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd challenge1
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

For detailed information, see [Challenge 1 README](challenge1/README.md).

### Challenge 2: (Coming Soon)
